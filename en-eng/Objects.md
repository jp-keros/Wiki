# Compatible objects


We try to keep a non-exhaustive list of compatible objects on the site [https://zigbee.blakadder.com](https://zigbee.blakadder.com/z4d.html). They are referenced under the Gateway __Zigbee for Domoticz__.


### My object is referenced for the Plugin :

If your item is listed on the site with the label __Zigbee for Domoticz__, it is that it is __certified__ : its operation with the plugin has been validated.
Now, there may be specifics to use it: see the [Particularit√©s de certains objets](Readme.md#devices-specifics)


### My object is not referenced for the Plugin :

Deux possibilities :

* The object works with the plugin natively. It will be good to update the site to indicate it: there is a small red button __Edit Page__ at the top right of the objects page.
* The object doesn't work or can't join correctly : please have a look to [What to do if the device doesn't behave correctly](Home.md#what-to-do-if-the-device-doesnt-behave-correctly).
