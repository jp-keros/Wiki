# The WebUI stastistics

With the launch of version 6, we added a statistics feature to the WebUI. This allows us to have information about the use of the plugin for the purpose of improving it.

The solution used to collect this data is  [Matomo](https://fr.matomo.org) (prevously Piwik) The solution used to collect this data is toto whose server we host ourselves..


## cookies

As the WebUI is a mini website, we use the cookie functionality placed in your browser. When you first open the WebUI, a banner at the bottom asks for your permission to collect this data.

**At any time**, it is possible to change your choice to send us your data using the __PluginAnalytics__ setting in the WebUI settings page.


## Transparency

In addition to the traditional information collected on websites (browser, operating system, display resolution, etc...), we collect the following information :

* the coordinator model

* the coordinator's firmware version

* the version of the Plugin

* the size of the ZigBee network


## Example of network size

The network size statistics can be reported to us in graphical form:

![Exemple r√©seau](../fr-fr/Images/FR_Statistiques-reseau.png)

The horizontal axis shows the total number of devices (routers + end devices). The vertical axis shows the number of routers (in blue) and end devices (in orange).

In the example, we see on the far right, a network with 56 deivces, including 19 routers and 37 end devices.


## Why ?

We are a small team of volunteers who share our time to develop this plugin.

With this little feedback, you allow us to know the use you make of it.

This way we can concentrate our efforts where it is most needed.

Thank you.
